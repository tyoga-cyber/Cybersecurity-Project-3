# Cybersecurity-Project-3


While working as a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.
The team confirmed that newly created alerts are working. The team will monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
It is requested to report back all your findings to both the SOC manager and the Engineering Manager with appropriate analysis.
